		<div class="column1">August 2016. Robin Afamefuna steps onto the grounds of UVa for the first time, his first time in Virginia, his first time visiting an American university. One year earlier, he was playing club soccer he was in the talent factory for Borussia Monchengladbach, one of the most successful clubs in Germany’s highest league, the Bundesliga. For Robin and other soccer players rising through the ranks of European super-clubs, his logical next step was not necessarily a move to the United States. But after a turn of events, and two years later, Robin is the captain of the University of Virginia’s top ten soccer team.</div>
		<div class="column1">August 2016. Anzel Viljoen enters UVa as a first year, her first time stepping onto the grounds of the university. About a year earlier in November 2015, she graduated high school in New Zealand. Her path to the next level of athletics could have gone two different ways, but she chose the one less travelled in moving to the United States. After navigating the recruiting process on her own, Anzel landed a spot on a nationally ranked American field hockey team. Two years later, Anzel is a regular on the field hockey team, even making the 2017 All-ACC Academic Team.

		<h2><i> The two are now thriving as students and as athletes at the University of Virginia, but how did they end up in the small town of Charlottesville after growing up on opposite sides of the world? </i></h2>
		<p><b style="font-size:larger">Robin Afamefuna </b> graduated high school in 2015, with plans of pursuing a professional soccer career. Growing up in the youth clubs of Germany’s Bundesliga, his future looked bright. His plan changed after tearing his meniscus, forced to sit out for the next six months. “[Robin] was starting to think of different options” when a recruiting agency, Monaco Sportstipendium, sparked his interest in American universities. Through this presentation, his path to the United States became clear: complete a few placement tests, send out a highlight tape, and wait for the offers. Robin’s talent caught the eye of many schools, and quickly received attention. Overwhelmed with choices, Robin “received about 28 offers from different colleges. I had all those names in front of me and no idea which colleges were the best ones, so I had to do all the research.” While the agency spread the word about his talent, Robin was on his own when it came down to his decision. “After the coaching staff reached out to me, I finally made my decision to come to UVa. Because the whole program, academics and athletics, was just so good.”</p>
		<p><b style="font-size:larger">Anzel Viljoen </b> had some friends in American universities, but didn’t know much about the schools or even the different field hockey programs. Once deciding she wanted to play field hockey for a university, Anzel got straight to work. While most players used the agency system to assist in their recruiting process, she “decided really late that I wanted to come to the US, so I just took all the film that I had of playing in New Zealand and made a recruiting video and then just looked up the top ten schools in America for field hockey and sent out an email to all of their coaches.” Seems simple, but her path to UVa consisted of endless paperwork, eligibility checks, and communication with coaches. Anzel felt she was one of the only players to not use an agency. After a few Skype calls with the head coaches, discussing her place on the team, her decision was made clear. Her meticulous research on each team that showed interest proved that Virginia’s program was the best option for Anzel; academically and athletically. </p>

		<div class="lefty"> Men’s soccer, with 12.1%, and women’s field hockey, with 10.2%, are two sports with the highest percentages of international student athletes on their team in Division I athletics. Regardless of the sport, it is apparent that the number of internationals on these college teams is increasing. Talented athletes around the world have a decision to make in high school: to pursue their sport at the next level, or to pursue academics. For American students, the college athletics system has made it possible for the youth to pursue both. This is something that most take for granted, but it is not an option in most other countries. Robin shared that “in Germany, we only have the chance to focus on one, like academics and athletics are completely separated from each other. I feel like more and more people are trying to take advantage of that.” Academics and athletics are separated. Anzel also shared that: “You can go to university and play your sport, it’s just you don’t get scholarships for it at all because it’s a separate thing, you won’t be playing for your university. I think the people who are serious about the sport will continue on.”</div>

		<p>Playing sports in college is a normal path for high school athletes in America; internationally, students must decide between studying and sports. It has become more popular for internationals to come to America because they are serious about both athletics and academics, and there are now more opportunities to pursue both through the NCAA program. With the growth of technology like Skype, YouTube, and social media, there are fewer barriers between countries when it comes to athletes and coaches. The college coaches have access to a broader range of talent, and are willing to give scholarship spots to internationals, since they have proven their dedication to their sport. </p>
		<div class="righty">As the pool of international talent grows, so has the industry of college recruiting. So-called “college recruiting agencies” have emerged to serve as a liaison between the international athlete and American universities. These are present in almost every country, and promise exposure to American universities in exchange for a fee, and it isn’t necessarily a small one. These agencies tour around to clubs for every sport, selling their ‘product’ of a potential scholarship to prominent colleges in the United States. The process seems simple: “you pay [the agency], and they take care of everything for you. They reach out to all the schools, and do all the communication for you. So really you don’t have to do anything apart from be good at your sport.” Anzel explained her view on the agency process, a route that she chose not to take by dealing with the process herself. “I preferred [doing it on my own]. But if you’re not the type of person who likes to just get things done on your own, it is helpful to have someone else. Because it is a lot of paperwork, and they can really help you settle into coming.” Shown on the left, agencies such as Monaco Sportstipendium show American universities in the best light, comparing it to college movies and showing packed stadiums at powerhouses such as Ohio State and Alabama. </div>
